# Module 08: Concurrency in Go - Parallel Programming Paradigms

## Introduction to Concurrency

Concurrency is a fundamental characteristic of modern computing, and Go was designed from the ground up to make concurrent programming both powerful and accessible. Unlike traditional threading models, Go introduces a unique approach to managing concurrent operations through goroutines and channels.

### The Concurrency Landscape

Before diving into Go's specific concurrency mechanisms, let's understand the core concepts:

1. **Concurrency vs Parallelism**
    - **Concurrency**: The ability to handle multiple tasks simultaneously by switching between them
    - **Parallelism**: Executing multiple tasks truly at the same time using multiple processors

2. **Why Concurrency Matters**
    - Improved application responsiveness
    - Efficient resource utilization
    - Handling I/O-bound and CPU-bound tasks effectively

### Goroutines: Lightweight Threads

Goroutines are Go's revolutionary approach to concurrent execution. They are lightweight threads managed by the Go runtime, allowing you to write concurrent code with minimal overhead.

```go
// Basic goroutine example
func main() {
    // Launch a goroutine
    go func() {
        fmt.Println("Hello from a goroutine!")
    }()

    // Main function continues immediately
    fmt.Println("Main function")

    // Small delay to allow goroutine to execute
    time.Sleep(time.Second)
}
```

#### Goroutine Characteristics
- Extremely lightweight (minimal memory overhead)
- Managed by Go runtime scheduler
- Can create thousands of goroutines simultaneously
- Multiplexed across fewer OS threads

### Channels: Communication Between Goroutines

Channels provide a mechanism for goroutines to communicate and synchronize their operations. They are the primary means of coordinating concurrent work in Go.

```go
// Unbuffered channel example
func main() {
    // Create a channel for integer communication
    messages := make(chan int)

    // Goroutine that sends a value
    go func() {
        messages <- 42  // Send value to channel
    }()

    // Receive value from channel
    value := <-messages
    fmt.Println("Received:", value)
}

// Buffered channel example
func main() {
    // Buffered channel can hold multiple values
    bufferedChannel := make(chan int, 3)
    
    bufferedChannel <- 1
    bufferedChannel <- 2
    bufferedChannel <- 3

    fmt.Println(<-bufferedChannel)  // Prints 1
    fmt.Println(<-bufferedChannel)  // Prints 2
}
```

#### Channel Types
- **Unbuffered Channels**: Synchronous communication
- **Buffered Channels**: Asynchronous communication with capacity
- **Directional Channels**: Restrict send/receive operations

### Select Statement: Multiplexing Channels

The `select` statement allows you to wait on multiple channel operations, providing powerful concurrency control.

```go
func main() {
    // Two channels for demonstration
    ch1 := make(chan string)
    ch2 := make(chan string)

    go func() {
        ch1 <- "First channel message"
    }()

    go func() {
        ch2 <- "Second channel message"
    }()

    // Select from multiple channels
    select {
    case msg1 := <-ch1:
        fmt.Println("Received from ch1:", msg1)
    case msg2 := <-ch2:
        fmt.Println("Received from ch2:", msg2)
    }
}
```

### Concurrency Patterns

#### 1. Worker Pool
```go
func workerPool(jobs <-chan int, results chan<- int) {
    for job := range jobs {
        // Process job
        results <- job * 2
    }
}

func main() {
    jobs := make(chan int, 100)
    results := make(chan int, 100)

    // Create worker goroutines
    for w := 1; w <= 3; w++ {
        go workerPool(jobs, results)
    }

    // Send jobs
    for j := 1; j <= 5; j++ {
        jobs <- j
    }
    close(jobs)

    // Collect results
    for a := 1; a <= 5; a++ {
        <-results
    }
}
```

#### 2. Timeout Handling
```go
func main() {
    ch := make(chan string)

    // Goroutine with potential long-running operation
    go func() {
        time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
        ch <- "operation complete"
    }()

    // Select with timeout
    select {
    case result := <-ch:
        fmt.Println(result)
    case <-time.After(1 * time.Second):
        fmt.Println("Operation timed out")
    }
}
```

### Synchronization Primitives

#### Mutex for Safe Concurrent Access
```go
type SafeCounter struct {
    mu sync.Mutex
    value map[string]int
}

func (c *SafeCounter) Inc(key string) {
    c.mu.Lock()
    defer c.mu.Unlock()
    c.value[key]++
}
```

### Common Concurrency Challenges

1. **Race Conditions**
    - Occur when multiple goroutines access shared data
    - Solved using mutexes or channel-based synchronization

2. **Deadlocks**
    - Situation where goroutines are waiting for each other
    - Prevented by careful channel and mutex management

3. **Resource Leaks**
    - Goroutines that don't terminate
    - Managed through proper channel closing and context usage

### Best Practices

1. Use channels for communication
2. Avoid sharing memory, instead pass memory by communicating
3. Keep goroutines short and focused
4. Use `context` for cancellation and timeouts
5. Always close channels when done

### Learning Challenges

1. Implement a concurrent web crawler
2. Build a rate limiter using channels
3. Create a pipeline for data processing
4. Develop a concurrent cache with proper synchronization
